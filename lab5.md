# Part 1 - Debugging <br/>
What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)? <br/>
Laptop, Win 11 x64, vscode, command prompt <br/>
Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.<br/>

The program should return the number as entered but through a recursion that counts up to the number. Since the input is 1234, we expect to see 1234 as output but 1 is shown instead. <br/>
Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.<br/>
Command Runned: ```javac Lab5.java java Lab5 1234``` <br/>
Working Directory: ~Desktop/cse15l/lab5 <br/>
No test cases or testers <br/>
