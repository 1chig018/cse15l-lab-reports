# Lab Report 4
In this lab report, we will clone github repo, run tests and fix bugs in code file, and commit changes on server according to the steps 4-9 in <https://ucsd-cse15l-s23.github.io/week/week7/#week7-lab-report>. <br/>
Step 1: loggin to ieng6 <br/>
Command: ```ssh cs15lsp23oz@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` <br/>
Since we have "saved" our password for ssh loggin on our computer following lab instructions, there's no request for password here. <br/>
